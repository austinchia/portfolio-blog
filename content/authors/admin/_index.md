Hi there! I'm Austin, a personable, data-driven individual with a strong belief in utilizing my skills for touching lives. As such, my interests lie in healthcare, biomedical informatics and biomedical data science. Currently a healthcare data analyst, I work on operations data for BI at a healthcare company. I'm also a Final-year Biological Sciences student in NTU.

My internship experience in healthcare data analytics, medical services, bio-data science and marketing analytics have provided me exposure to the various applications of data science in healthcare. I actively take on student leadership roles, involving interpersonal communication, conflict resolution and project management.

I'm an avid self-learner and I enjoy exploring new skills. I also enjoy writing and have founded a data science & analytics skills blog - Anyinstructor.
