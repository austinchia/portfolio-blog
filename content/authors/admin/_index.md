I am a personable, data-driven individual with a strong belief in utilizing data in the healthcare industry or biomedical informatics. With proven 1-year internship experiences in data analytics, I am well-versed in the applications of data in business settings through use of [R](https://www.r-project.org/)
, [Tableau](https://www.tableau.com/), [Structured Query Language (SQL)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SQL), [Microsoft Excel](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/excel) and [Python](https://www.python.org/).

Presently, I am a healthcare data analyst, working part-time on operations data for BI at a healthtech firm alongside my college studies in the final-year of my Biological Sciences major studies in [Nanyang Technological University](https://www.ntu.edu.sg/).

Apart from work and studies, I also actively take on key student leadership roles. I am an avid self-learner and I enjoy exploring new skills. I also enjoy writing and have founded a data science & analytics skills blog - [Anyinstructor.com](https://anyinstructor.com/). Through the several skills gained, I completed some personal projects in data science.

If any of my experiences and goals align with yours, feel free to contact me through [email](mailto:austin.chia.ce@gmail.com) or through the buttons on the left. 

Currently Seeking: Full-time Data Analytics/Data Science positions (Jun 2021 Onwards)
